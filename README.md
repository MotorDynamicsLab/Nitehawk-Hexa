# Nitehawk-Hexa

Nitehawk Hexa is a 6+1 port USB hub adapter purpose-built for USB-based toolboards. It integrates the capabilities of six Nitehawk USB adapters, a USB 2.0 hub, and a 24V power splitter into a single, compact PCB. Nitehawk Hexa is the ideal solution for multi-toolhead 3D printers such as IDEX or toolchanger systems, offering a clean and reliable way to manage power and communication across multiple toolboards.

## Features:

- Convenient wiring, use a single 24V power cable (included) and standard USB C cable upstream to handle power and data of up to 6 downstream toolboards.
- Plug and play, functions just like a normal USB hub â€” no additional software, drivers, or configuration required.
- Extra USB-A port, an extra USB A port downstream allows you to plug in any standard USB device (webcam, flash drive, Arduino etc.)
- 30A current rating, engineered for demanding setups with up to six heated toolheads. Features a high-current screw terminal rated for 30A and dedicated power/ground planes on the PCB to support heavy loads safely.
- Dedicated power protection, each downstream port includes its own data line protection and a replaceable fuse. The upstream USB-C input is protected by standard USB ESD protection circuitry.
